### Ilya Zhitomirskiy {#ilya}
**Image**: ../images/resources/people/nerds/ilya.jpg

One of the four founders of much-hyped open-source social network Diaspora, nicknames a "Facebook killer."

There exist some conspiracies surrounding his alleged "suicide" and autopsy, though not much about it can be easily found. George W Hunt wrote a piece giving insight into the nature of his death and his belief that the death was not a suicide, but rather murder.

• [Read it here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140305020854/http://www.thebigbadbank.com/videos/how-the-press-lied-about-the-murder-of-ilya-zhitomirskiy/)

On Oct, 20, 2011, Business Insider wrote: "PayPal was blocking social networking startup Diaspora from accessing any of the donations in its PayPal account. No one seemed to know why – Diaspora indicated that it's happening "arbitrarily." This happened on the heels of Diaspora reaching out to its users to ask for more donations on top of the $200,000+ already raised via Kickstarter. After lots of tweets and emails from Diaspora users, PayPal has unfrozen the account, reports Launch.is."

It is pretty evident that certain corporations saw him as a threat, and given no prior mental issues, the conspiracies surrounding his death are not surprising.

## Philosophers {#philosophy}
**Role**: And Free Thinkers
**Image**: ../images/resources/people/phil.png

### Alain de Botton {#botton}
**Image**: ../images/resources/people/phil/alain.webp

• [Alain de Botton's Personal Page](https://www.alaindebotton.com/)

Personally, I am a big fan of Alain de Botton. Though he has faced a myriad of scrutiny in the philosophical world for his definition of the subject, as a simpleton myself (at least when it comes to philosophy), I thoroughly enjoy his literature and the topics his works lead me to ponder about.

In his book "The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work", Botton explores and documents careers some may deem "mundane" (if even acknowledged). Without displaying strong bias in his accounts, he writes about the joys and perils of the modern workplace, and the various occupations people around the world hold. He leads the reader through a day in the life of each profession he explores, giving insight into worlds I had never given much thought to.

What I appreciate about this book is that it made me question how things in my surroundings got to be there, such as a chair picked up from a second-hand store or a fish at the supermarket.

Some other works of his that I liked:

[The Art of Travel](https://www.alaindebotton.com/)

[Status Anxiety](https://www.alaindebotton.com/status/)

Funny picture I found of him with Harry Styles.

### Gilles Deleuze {#deleuze}
**Image**: ../images/resources/people/phil/deluze.webp

• [Gilles Deleuze](https://iep.utm.edu/gilles-deleuze/)

I love mathematician philosophers teehee.

"Deleuze conceived of philosophy as the production of concepts, and he characterized himself as a "pure metaphysician." In his magnum opus Difference and Repetition, he tries to develop a metaphysics adequate to contemporary mathematics and science—a metaphysics in which the concept of multiplicity replaces that of substance, event replaces essence and virtuality replaces possibility."

### Mark Fisher {#fisher}
**Image**: ../images/resources/people/phil/fisher.jpg

• [Mark Fisher](https://gasgiants.substack.com/p/ghosts-of-my-life-mark-fisher-2014)

May he rest in peace.

I sometimes wish I was more competent in literature and analysis, because though I enjoy reading him, I struggle with understanding and even sometimes comprehending what mark fisher has to say. His works on capitalism and politics would probably resonate with me, but I will have to come back to him at another time.

Some works that I want to come back to:

[Ghosts of my Life](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/mark-fisher-ghosts-retromania/)

[The Weird and the Eerie](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/making-sense-of-the-weird-and-the-eerie/)
