"Air Bear" sculpture by Joshua Allen Harris (2008)

"Air Bear" is a small polar bear sculpture designed by Joshua Allen Harris in 2008. He was created out of white plastic grocery bags and attached to the grating above the NYC subway.

When the sculpture is at rest, it looks like an ordinary piece of trash on the grating. But as the subway passes by, it pushes air up through the grating, animating the bear in a life-like way.

## Dunning-Kruger effect {#kruger}
**Category**: Science

TLDR: The more you know, the less you think you know.

The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate their knowledge or abilities. It's more common in people who have low abilities and lack self-awareness, since people with low abilities may not have the skills to recognize their own incompetence.

Some also include the opposite effect for high performers and their tendency to underestimate their skills.

Term coined in 1999 by Cornell University psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger.

## Loss Meme {#loss}

**Image**: ../images/resources/terms/l.png

Originated with this cartoon strip posted in 2008.
The comic was mocked and parodied with minimalistic representations of the 4 panels.

References to this are still made to this day, making it one of the longest running internet gags.

Lacan's Mirror Stage

Recognizing yourself in the mirror!

Theory: Human infants pass through a stage in which an external image of the body (reflected in a mirror, or represented to the infant through the mother or primary caregiver) produces a psychic response that gives rise to the mental representation of an "I".

Sundogs are bright spots of light that appear on either left, right, or both, from the sun. They are caused by refractions of light through ice crystals.

Note: In Russian, a sunbeam reflection is called a 'солнычный зайчик', which translates to Sunny Bunny :)
