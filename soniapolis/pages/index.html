                                    I started going to the movies alone. I don't know if it makes me indulge
                                    in solitude, but I like doing something for myself. I <3 the movies, and I don't
                                    necessarily want to go with anyone. Outside of Daniel (who is at work) and Bea
                                    (who is also at work), I don't know who I would take. I have become a lone wolf,
                                    but I like to romanticize it. I wish to try and grow in my solitude, but it
                                    becomes hard as I am stuck with myself and quickly fall into dispair. I think it
                                    is because I have no one to impress. <br> <br>

                                    My program is killing me, I fear that I am being drained of my soul. I can't
                                    care about
                                    myself right now, not because I don't want to but because I don't have time. I
                                    am also scared of
                                    the people in my program,, so I must force myself to be a blank as to not draw
                                    attention to myself.

                                    For the first time in my life, I feel like I'm working for and towards myself. This outlook might not be shared, but I
                                    viewed my Bachelor's as a general requirement, a stepping stone in the trajectory of life. Though school was important,
                                    social life and fun were seemingly my priority throughout my time there.
                                    Generally, depending on what your goals are of course, a higher degree is not an obligation. If it's not prioritized, it's
                                    a waste of time and effort and money, all finite resources. <br> <br>

                                    depressed or something, but I try to do the "right" things about it. I started
                                    seeing a
                                    therapist, but I think he is trying to get rid of me. Even though he said "Not that

                                    to get rid of you," but that's what put the idea in my head. <br><br>

                                    As silly as it sounds, I feel more like an adult now. This may be a result of turning 22, but there's a newfound feeling of respect
                                    from my colleagues and professors. There's a comradery in everyone pursuing the same goal. The classes are small so participation is
                                    easier for shy me, which helps my usually prevalent imposter syndrome.

                                    Sometimes I wish I could have more of a social media presence. I'm too conscious of
                                    my audience – even now as
                                    I write this I'm thinking of who will read it even though only about 3 people know
                                    about this site's
                                    existence and I doubt any of them will even read this. <br> <br>

                                    On one hand it doesn't matter and I should do and say what I want, wherever I want,
                                    but on the other hand
                                    why do I feel the need to do so on a platform catered for others viewing it. Social
                                    media in itself is
                                    meant to be exactly that – social. Why say it online if it is not for others to
                                    react to it. I guess that's
                                    why I built this site, to have it be personal but accessible to select few. No
                                    matter what I do with social media,
                                    I'm falling into some form of expectation and societal pressure.

                                    This is the reason I will never become like those I praise online. Everything public
                                    feels inevitably performative,
                                    there is no casualty in it. I can't have a big online presence because once people
                                    can see it, it's no longer going into
                                    a void. People can form thoughts and opinions on what I say or look like without
                                    knowing me personally.

                                    All that said, I don't have this outlook towards those who chose to have a public
                                    online presence.
                                    I love seeing what others post but can't see this outlook mirrored towards
                                    myself.<br> <br>

                                    My new idea is to have a section called "things I would tweet if I was confident
                                    enough to use twitter". I think I
                                    will just call it "unsent tweets". <br> <br>

                                    I have been thinking about my future lately...

                                    I don't know what to do with my life!! I heavily considered going into optometry
                                    today after
                                    a visit to the office with my sister. I just really like all the tech they use, but
                                    I might
                                    feel like a fraud having good vision in the field, won't be able to relate to my
                                    patients :p
                                    Does Dr.Sharapova have a ring to it?

                                    I do love computer science, but I am struggling in finding a niche to which I can
                                    apply it to. The infinite
                                    range of possibilities in programming is both its blessing and curse. For now, I
                                    will continue to build my skills
                                    and see what to do with them when the time comes.

                                    It could also be interesting to become a hacker or something along those lines.
                                    Cyber-security is so important nowadays
                                    but also feels nonsensical given how public all of my personal information is.

                                    At the end of the day, I just want to be interested and proud of what I do and
                                    contribute to (and hopefully sustain
                                    myself through it).

                                    Humans have evolved tooo far. Why must we need emotional pain, and why is it just as
                                    hurtful
                                    as physical pain.

                                    over.
                                    I have EVERYTHING and yet I still find reasons to be miserable. What is wrong with

                                    <br>
                                    "one of the most widely ramifying features of modernity is the intense focus on the
                                    value and power of the individual self. To turn away from the search of an objective
                                    external order and to instead turn inward and become aware of our own activity"

                                    experience. It breeds comfort, allowing people to act selfishly. This shows an

                                    Feeling overwhelmed by the amount of stuff in the world. Thinking about the quantity
                                    of meaningless
                                    items makes me ill. I wish I wasn't such a material girl, but I am trying my best to
                                    change. Overconsumption
                                    and consumerism is so ingrained within moi aussi >_< <br><br>
                                        I do find myself guilty of partaking in retail therapy. Personally, when I
                                        cannot fix some internal conflicts,
                                        I try to change something externally. Shopping offers a quick and easy solution
                                        to resolve the monotony
                                        I feel within myself, and I have not yet found a good replacement for this. I
                                        just love the video store so much!

                                    On the topic of overconsumption, clothing and accessories are so accessible now that
                                    trend cycles
                                    move way too fast and people struggle with using their style to stand out. Trend
                                    cycles used to be ~every 10
                                    years, but with the huge desire for individuality, these cycles seem to have a
                                    shorter and shorter
                                    cycle length. Tell me why I am seeing 2016 throwbacks when 2022 just started. I
                                    think that people are so aware
                                    of "trend cycles" that instead of allowing them to happen naturally, people try to
                                    "predict" the new trends by
                                    following previous patterns.
                                </p2>

                                    This doesn't seem to work in modern times as I rarely see any new and original
                                    additions to
                                    these past styles, and instead see people trying to replicate them. Of course this
                                    is also fun in its own way,
                                    but there is not much originality in it.

                                    I am such a bad texter I just cant do it. With most things in life my mind takes the
                                    approach of
                                    "out of sign out of mind", but this thought process makes it very hard for me to
                                    stay in touch with
                                    people when we are apart.

                                    I also have conversations with people in my head and forget whether they were real
                                    or not. I am always
                                    telling people things in my brain, and it clashes with my reality. This happens in
                                    my weird sleep
                                    paralysis dreams as well. Makes living very surreal at times.

                                    from 2008-2013. Isn’t as funny as I remember but interesting to look back on.
                                    Comedy in the early ages of the internet was so autistic — lots of facebook
                                    roasts, selfie mockings (+ general woman humour), photo reactions, and lady
                                    gaga jokes (forgot how widespread poker face parodies were).<br>
                                    Highlights: college girl of the week reels.
